# YouTube Video Playback Fix

## Issue

YouTube videos were not playing in the timeline/feed, but were working correctly on the video details page.

## Root Cause

The frontend components were checking for `video?.videoUrl?.embedUrl` which doesn't exist in the data structure.

### Actual Data Structure

When a video is uploaded to YouTube, the backend returns:

```javascript
{
  public_id: youtubeResult.videoId,
  url: youtubeResult.embedUrl,  // <-- The embed URL is stored here
  provider: 'youtube',
  videoId: youtubeResult.videoId,
  thumbnailUrl: youtubeResult.thumbnailUrl
}
```

This object is saved as `videoUrl` in the Video document:

```javascript
{
  videoUrl: {
    url: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID",  // <-- Embed URL
    provider: "youtube",
    videoId: "VIDEO_ID",
    thumbnailUrl: "..."
  },
  storageProvider: "youtube"
}
```

### The Problem

Frontend components were checking:

- ❌ `video?.videoUrl?.embedUrl` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ Using `video?.videoUrl?.embedUrl || src` as fallback

This caused YouTube videos to not be detected properly, so they weren't rendered as iframes.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed YouTube Video Detection

Updated the logic to check multiple conditions:

```javascript
const isYouTubeVideo =
  video?.videoUrl?.provider === 'youtube' ||
  video?.storageProvider === 'youtube' ||
  src?.includes('youtube.com/embed');
```

### 2. Fixed iframe src Attribute

Changed from:

```javascript
<YouTubeEmbed src={video?.videoUrl?.embedUrl || src} />
```

To:

```javascript
<YouTubeEmbed src={src} /> // or video?.videoUrl?.url
```

Since `src` is already set to `video?.videoUrl?.url` at the top of the component.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/client/src/components/PostCard.jsx`

**Lines 89-93:** Updated YouTube video detection

```javascript
const isYouTubeVideo =
  video?.videoUrl?.provider === 'youtube' ||
  video?.storageProvider === 'youtube' ||
  src?.includes('youtube.com/embed');
```

**Line 110:** Fixed iframe src

```javascript
<YouTubeEmbed src={src} />
```

### 2. `/client/src/pages/Video.jsx`

**Lines 386-389:** Updated YouTube video detection

```javascript
const isYouTubeVideo =
  currentVideo?.videoUrl?.provider === 'youtube' ||
  currentVideo?.storageProvider === 'youtube' ||
  currentVideo?.videoUrl?.url?.includes('youtube.com/embed');
```

**Line 402:** Fixed iframe src

```javascript
<YouTubePlayer src={currentVideo?.videoUrl.url} />
```

## Testing

### Before Fix

- ❌ YouTube videos not playing in timeline/feed
- ✅ YouTube videos playing on details page (by accident, due to fallback)

### After Fix

- ✅ YouTube videos playing in timeline/feed
- ✅ YouTube videos playing on details page
- ✅ Cloudinary videos still working correctly
- ✅ Images still displaying correctly

## How to Test

1. **Upload a video to YouTube:**

   - Go to Upload page
   - Select a video file
   - Make sure YouTube is selected as storage provider
   - Upload and post

2. **Check Timeline:**

   - Go to home page
   - Find your uploaded video
   - Video should display as YouTube iframe embed
   - Video should play correctly

3. **Check Video Details:**

   - Click on the video to open details page
   - Video should display and play correctly

4. **Verify Cloudinary Videos:**
   - Upload a video with Cloudinary selected
   - Verify it still plays correctly in both timeline and details page

## Technical Notes

### YouTube Embed URL Format

```
https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID
```

### Detection Priority

The code checks three conditions (in order):

1. `video?.videoUrl?.provider === 'youtube'` - Most reliable
2. `video?.storageProvider === 'youtube'` - Backup check
3. `src?.includes('youtube.com/embed')` - URL pattern check

### Why Multiple Checks?

- **Provider field:** Most reliable, set during upload
- **Storage provider:** Database field, always present
- **URL pattern:** Fallback for edge cases or legacy data

## Status

✅ **Fixed and Ready for Testing**

The frontend will automatically pick up these changes when the page is refreshed. No server restart needed.
