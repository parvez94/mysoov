# Access Code System Implementation

## Overview

The access code system allows admins to upload videos with optional access codes (e.g., "John-231-GC"). Videos with access codes are hidden from public feeds and can only be discovered by searching for the specific code in the navigation search bar.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema ✅

**File:** `/server/models/Video.js`

- Added `accessCode` field (String, default: null)
- Added database index on `accessCode` for optimized search performance
- Supports null values for public videos without codes

### 2. Upload Form ✅

**File:** `/client/src/pages/Upload.jsx`

- Added access code input field after caption (visible to admins only)
- Uses Redux to check if current user has admin role
- Placeholder text: "e.g., John-231-GC"
- Help text explaining that videos with codes are hidden from public feed
- Trims whitespace and saves as null if empty
- Case-insensitive storage (saved as-is, searched case-insensitively)
- Regular users do not see this field

### 3. Navigation Search Bar ✅

**File:** `/client/src/components/Navbar.jsx`

- Updated search bar to be functional
- Placeholder: "Search by access code..."
- Navigates to `/search?q={code}` on Enter key or search icon click
- Clears search input after navigation

### 4. Search Results Page ✅

**File:** `/client/src/pages/SearchResults.jsx` (NEW)

- Displays videos matching the access code
- Shows loading state while fetching
- Displays error messages if search fails
- Shows "No videos found" when no results
- Displays search query in a styled badge
- Shows count of results found
- Responsive grid layout using existing Card component

### 5. Backend Search Endpoint ✅

**File:** `/server/controllers/videoCtrl.js`

- New function: `searchByAccessCode`
- Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/videos/search?code={accessCode}`
- Case-insensitive search using regex
- Returns videos sorted by creation date (newest first)
- Includes comment counts for each video
- Validates that code parameter is provided

**File:** `/server/routes/videoRoutes.js`

- Added route: `router.get('/search', searchByAccessCode)`

### 6. Frontend Routing ✅

**File:** `/client/src/App.jsx`

- Added route: `/search` → `<SearchResults />`
- Imported SearchResults component

### 7. Public Feed Filtering ✅

Updated all public video queries to exclude videos with access codes:

**Modified Functions:**

- `randomVideos` - Home page random videos
- `trend` - Trending videos
- `videoFeeds` - Following feed
- `search` - Caption search (old search function)
- `getUserVideos` - User profile videos (when viewing others)

**Filter Logic:**

```javascript
{
  privacy: 'Public',
  $or: [
    { accessCode: null },
    { accessCode: { $exists: false } }
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

### For Admins (Uploading):

1. Navigate to Upload page
2. Fill in video details (title, caption, etc.)
3. **Optional:** Enter an access code (e.g., "John-231-GC")
4. If access code is provided, video will be hidden from public feeds
5. If access code is left empty, video appears in public feeds normally

### For Users (Searching):

1. Type access code in the top navigation search bar
2. Press Enter or click the search icon
3. View all videos with that access code
4. Same code can be used for multiple videos
5. Search is case-insensitive ("john-231-gc" = "John-231-GC")

### Privacy Behavior:

- **Videos WITHOUT access code:** Appear in home feed, trending, explore, user profiles
- **Videos WITH access code:** Only accessible via code search, hidden from all public feeds
- **Owner's view:** Admins can see their own videos with access codes in their profile/dashboard
- **Access code field visibility:** Only admins can see and use the access code field in the upload form

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing:

```bash
# Start the server
cd server
npm run dev

# Test 1: Upload video with access code
POST /api/v1/videos
Body: {
  "caption": "Test Video",
  "videoUrl": "...",
  "accessCode": "TEST-123"
}

# Test 2: Search by access code
GET /api/v1/videos/search?code=TEST-123
GET /api/v1/videos/search?code=test-123  # Case-insensitive

# Test 3: Verify video is hidden from public feed
GET /api/v1/videos/random
# Should NOT include videos with accessCode

# Test 4: Upload video without access code
POST /api/v1/videos
Body: {
  "caption": "Public Video",
  "videoUrl": "..."
}

# Test 5: Verify public video appears in feed
GET /api/v1/videos/random
# Should include videos without accessCode
```

### Frontend Testing:

1. **Admin Access Code Field:**

   - Login as admin user
   - Go to `/upload`
   - Verify access code field is visible
   - Login as regular user
   - Go to `/upload`
   - Verify access code field is NOT visible

2. **Upload with Access Code (Admin Only):**

   - Login as admin
   - Go to `/upload`
   - Fill in video details
   - Enter access code: "John-231-GC"
   - Submit and verify success

3. **Search by Code:**

   - Type "John-231-GC" in top nav search bar
   - Press Enter
   - Verify redirect to `/search?q=John-231-GC`
   - Verify video appears in results

4. **Case-Insensitive Search:**

   - Search for "john-231-gc" (lowercase)
   - Verify same video appears

5. **Multiple Videos Same Code:**

   - Upload another video with "John-231-GC"
   - Search for code
   - Verify both videos appear

6. **Public Feed Exclusion:**

   - Go to home page
   - Verify videos with access codes don't appear
   - Go to explore page
   - Verify videos with access codes don't appear

7. **No Results:**

   - Search for non-existent code "INVALID-999"
   - Verify "No videos found" message appears

8. **Empty Search:**
   - Try searching with empty string
   - Verify appropriate error handling

## Database Indexes

The `accessCode` field has been indexed for performance:

```javascript
accessCode: {
  type: String,
  default: null,
  index: true  // Optimizes search queries
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Access codes are NOT passwords:** They provide obscurity, not security
2. **Anyone with the code can view:** No authentication required beyond knowing the code
3. **Codes are visible to admins:** In their own dashboard/profile
4. **Codes are hidden from regular users:** Not exposed in video metadata to non-owners

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- [ ] Admin dashboard column showing access codes
- [ ] Edit/remove access codes from existing videos
- [ ] Access code analytics (view count per code)
- [ ] Expiring access codes (time-limited)
- [ ] Access code usage limits (max views)
- [ ] Bulk assign same code to multiple videos
- [ ] Generate random access codes automatically

| Method | Endpoint                            | Description                                              |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/api/v1/videos`                    | Create video (include `accessCode` in body)              |
| GET    | `/api/v1/videos/search?code={code}` | Search videos by access code                             |
| GET    | `/api/v1/videos/random`             | Get random public videos (excludes access code videos)   |
| GET    | `/api/v1/videos/feeds`              | Get following feed (excludes access code videos)         |
| GET    | `/api/v1/users/:id/videos`          | Get user videos (excludes access code videos for others) |

## Files Modified

### Backend:

1. `/server/models/Video.js` - Added accessCode field
2. `/server/controllers/videoCtrl.js` - Added search endpoint + filtered public queries
3. `/server/routes/videoRoutes.js` - Added search route
4. `/server/controllers/userCtrl.js` - Filtered user profile videos

### Frontend:

1. `/client/src/pages/Upload.jsx` - Added access code input
2. `/client/src/components/Navbar.jsx` - Made search functional
3. `/client/src/pages/SearchResults.jsx` - Created new page
4. `/client/src/App.jsx` - Added search route

## Notes

- Access codes are trimmed of whitespace before saving
- Empty access codes are saved as `null` (not empty string)
- Search uses MongoDB regex for case-insensitive matching
- Videos with access codes can still be viewed directly via URL if ID is known
- Owner can always see their own videos with access codes in their profile
- Comment counts are included in search results for consistency

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check browser console for frontend errors
2. Check server logs for backend errors
3. Verify MongoDB connection is active
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed
5. Clear browser cache if search bar doesn't work
