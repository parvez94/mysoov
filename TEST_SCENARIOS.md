## Test Scenario 6: Admin Rejects Review

**Objective:** Verify admin can reject and content stays private

## Edge Cases to Test

### Edge Case 1: Concurrent Edits

- Owner edits post while admin is reviewing
- Expected: Latest changes are saved, review flag persists

### Edge Case 2: Admin Deletes Notification

- Admin deletes notification before reviewing
- Expected: Post still shows "Pending Review" badge in dashboard

### Edge Case 3: Post Deleted During Review

- Owner deletes post while it's pending review
- Expected: Notification becomes invalid, clicking it shows "Content not found"

### Edge Case 4: Multiple Admins

- Multiple admins receive same notification
- Expected: All admins can review, first approval/rejection wins

### Edge Case 5: Owner Changes Privacy Multiple Times

- Owner toggles privacy back and forth during edit
- Expected: Backend enforces Private regardless of toggle state

## Automated Test Script (Optional)

```javascript
// Example Jest/Cypress test
describe('Content Moderation Workflow', () => {
  it('should keep paused content private after edit', async () => {
    // 1. Admin pauses content
    await adminPausePost(postId);

    // 2. Owner edits and tries to make public
    const response = await ownerEditPost(postId, { privacy: 'Public' });

    // 3. Verify it's still private
    expect(response.data.privacy).toBe('Private');
    expect(response.data.pendingReview).toBe(true);

    // 4. Verify admin notification created
    const notifications = await getAdminNotifications();
    expect(notifications).toContainEqual(
      expect.objectContaining({
        type: 'review_requested',
        relatedVideo: postId,
      })
    );
  });

  it('should navigate to highlighted post from notification', async () => {
    // 1. Click notification
    await clickNotification(notificationId);

    // 2. Verify URL
    expect(window.location.pathname).toBe('/dashboard/posts');
    expect(window.location.search).toContain(`highlight=${postId}`);

    // 3. Verify highlight applied
    const highlightedRow = await findHighlightedRow();
    expect(highlightedRow).toHaveStyle(
      'border-left: 3px solid var(--primary-color)'
    );
  });
});
```
