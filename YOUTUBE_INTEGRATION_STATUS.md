# YouTube Storage Integration - Implementation Status

## ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

The YouTube video storage integration is **100% complete** and ready for testing!

## 📋 What Has Been Implemented

### Backend (Server-Side)

1. **YouTube Uploader Service** (`/server/utils/youtubeUploader.js`)

   - OAuth 2.0 authentication with Google
   - Video upload to YouTube as "unlisted"
   - Automatic token refresh handling
   - Error handling and fallback to Cloudinary

2. **Storage Settings API** (`/server/controllers/adminCtrl.js`)

   - `GET /api/v1/admin/storage-settings` - Fetch current storage configuration
   - `PUT /api/v1/admin/storage-settings` - Update storage provider selection
   - YouTube configuration status check

3. **Upload Routes** (`/server/routes/uploadRoutes.js`)

   - Refactored to support multiple storage providers
   - Automatic provider selection based on admin settings
   - Fallback mechanism if YouTube upload fails

4. **Database Models**

   - `Video` model updated with `storageProvider` field
   - `Settings` model for storing storage configuration

5. **Setup Script** (`/server/scripts/setupYouTube.js`)
   - Interactive OAuth flow for obtaining refresh token
   - Easy setup process for YouTube API credentials

### Frontend (Client-Side)

1. **Admin Settings UI** (`/client/src/pages/dashboard/DashboardSettings.jsx`)

   - ✅ Radio button selection between Cloudinary and YouTube
   - ✅ Visual status badges ("Configured" / "Not Configured")
   - ✅ Disabled state for unconfigured YouTube option
   - ✅ In-app setup instructions with code snippets
   - ✅ Save functionality with loading states
   - ✅ Error handling and user feedback

2. **Video Player** (`/client/src/pages/Video.jsx`)

   - ✅ YouTube iframe player for YouTube videos
   - ✅ Standard HTML5 player for Cloudinary videos
   - ✅ Automatic detection of video source
   - ✅ Proper styling and responsive design

- [ ] Configure OAuth consent screen
- [ ] Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
- [ ] Add environment variables to `.env`:
  ```env
  YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
  YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
  YOUTUBE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/api/v1/youtube/oauth2callback
  ```
- [ ] Run setup script: `node server/scripts/setupYouTube.js`
- [ ] Add `YOUTUBE_REFRESH_TOKEN` to `.env`
- [ ] Restart server

### Phase 2: Test Admin Settings UI

- [ ] Log in as admin
- [ ] Navigate to Dashboard → Settings
- [ ] Scroll to "Video Storage Provider" section
- [ ] Verify YouTube shows "Configured" badge (if setup complete)

- [ ] Verify YouTube player loads and plays correctly
- [ ] Test on mobile/responsive view
- [ ] Verify controls work (play, pause, fullscreen)

### Phase 5: Test Fallback Mechanism

- [ ] Temporarily break YouTube credentials (wrong token)
- [ ] Try uploading a video
- [ ] Verify it falls back to Cloudinary
- [ ] Check server logs for fallback message
- [ ] Restore correct credentials

### Phase 6: Test Switching Providers

- [ ] Switch back to Cloudinary in admin settings
