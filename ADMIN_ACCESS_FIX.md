# Admin Access Fix - Content Moderation

## 🐛 Problem Identified

When an admin paused a post and the owner edited it (making it private), the admin couldn't view the post to review it because of privacy restrictions. This created a critical workflow blocker:

1. Admin pauses post → Post becomes private
2. Owner edits post → Post stays private (pending review)
3. Admin receives notification → Clicks "View"
4. **❌ Admin gets "403 This video is private" error**
5. Admin cannot review the post!

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Modified the privacy check logic in both video and article controllers to allow **admins to bypass privacy restrictions** for review purposes.

### Files Modified (2):

1. `/server/controllers/videoCtrl.js` - `getVideo()` function
2. `/server/controllers/blogCtrl.js` - `getArticleBySlug()` function

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. Video Controller (`videoCtrl.js`)

**Before:**

```javascript
// Check privacy: if video is private, only owner can view it
if (video.privacy === 'Private') {
  const currentUserId = req.user?.id;
  if (!currentUserId || String(currentUserId) !== String(video.userId)) {
    return next(createError(403, 'This video is private'));
  }
}
```

**After:**

```javascript
// Check privacy: if video is private, only owner or admin can view it
if (video.privacy === 'Private') {
  const currentUserId = req.user?.id;
  const isAdmin = req.user?.role === 'admin';
  const isOwner =
    currentUserId && String(currentUserId) === String(video.userId);

  if (!isOwner && !isAdmin) {
    return next(createError(403, 'This video is private'));
  }
}
```

**Key Changes:**

- ✅ Added `isAdmin` check using `req.user?.role === 'admin'`
- ✅ Added `isOwner` variable for clarity
- ✅ Allow access if user is **either** owner **or** admin

### 2. Blog Controller (`blogCtrl.js`)

**Before:**

```javascript
// Check if article is paused and user is not the author
if (article.isPaused && String(article.author._id) !== String(currentUserId)) {
  return next(createError(403, 'This article is currently unavailable'));
}
```

**After:**

```javascript
const isAdmin = req.user?.role === 'admin';

// ... (in query logic)
// If not found, check if user is the author or admin and allow viewing paused/draft article
if (!article && currentUserId) {
  article = await Article.findOne({
    slug,
    $or: [
      { author: currentUserId },
      ...(isAdmin ? [{}] : []), // Admin can view any article
    ],
  })
    .populate('author', 'displayName username profilePic')
    .lean();
}

// Check if article is paused and user is not the author or admin
const isAuthor = String(article.author._id) === String(currentUserId);
if (article.isPaused && !isAuthor && !isAdmin) {
  return next(createError(403, 'This article is currently unavailable'));
}
```

**Key Changes:**

- ✅ Added `isAdmin` check at the beginning
- ✅ Modified query to allow admins to find any article (even paused/draft)
- ✅ Updated privacy check to allow admins to view paused articles

## 🎬 Updated Workflow

Now the complete workflow works correctly:

```
1. Admin pauses post
   ↓
2. Post becomes private (owner can still see it)
   ↓
3. Owner edits post and tries to make public
   ↓
4. Backend forces it to stay private
   ↓
5. Admin receives notification with "View" button
   ↓
6. Admin clicks "View"
   ↓
7. Dashboard loads → Post is highlighted → Page scrolls to post
   ↓
8. Admin clicks on post to view details
   ↓
9. ✅ Admin can now view the private post (FIXED!)
   ↓
10. Admin reviews content
   ↓
11. Admin clicks "Unpause" to approve
   ↓
12. Post becomes public, owner gets notification
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### ✅ What's Protected:

- Regular users still **cannot** view other users' private content
- Only the **owner** or **admin** can view private posts
- Admin role is checked from `req.user.role` (set during authentication)
- No security bypass for non-admin users

### ✅ Admin Privileges:

- Admins can view **any** private video/post
- Admins can view **any** paused article
- Admins can view **any** draft article
- This is necessary for content moderation duties

### ⚠️ Important Notes:

1. **Admin role must be properly authenticated** - Ensure your authentication middleware correctly sets `req.user.role`
2. **Role-based access control** - The User model has `role` field with enum `['user', 'admin']`
3. **No privilege escalation** - Regular users cannot change their role to admin (this should be enforced in user update endpoints)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Test Case 1: Admin Views Private Post

- [ ] Login as admin
- [ ] Navigate to a private post (via notification or direct URL)
- [ ] **Expected:** Admin can view the post content
- [ ] **Expected:** No "403 This video is private" error

### Test Case 2: Admin Views Paused Article

- [ ] Login as admin
- [ ] Navigate to a paused article (via notification or direct URL)
- [ ] **Expected:** Admin can view the article content
- [ ] **Expected:** No "403 This article is currently unavailable" error

### Test Case 3: Regular User Cannot View Others' Private Content

- [ ] Login as regular user (User A)
- [ ] Try to access another user's (User B) private post
- [ ] **Expected:** "403 This video is private" error
- [ ] **Expected:** User A cannot view User B's private content

### Test Case 4: Owner Can Still View Own Private Content

- [ ] Login as post owner
- [ ] Navigate to own private post
- [ ] **Expected:** Owner can view their own private post
- [ ] **Expected:** No errors

### Test Case 5: Complete Review Workflow

- [ ] Admin pauses a post

---

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Pre-Deployment:

1. ✅ Review code changes in both controllers
2. ✅ Ensure authentication middleware sets `req.user.role` correctly
3. ✅ Verify admin users have `role: 'admin'` in database

### Post-Deployment:

1. ✅ Test admin access to private posts
2. ✅ Test admin access to paused articles
3. ✅ Verify regular users still cannot access others' private content
4. ✅ Test complete review workflow end-to-end

### Rollback Plan:

If issues arise, revert the two controller files to previous versions:

- `/server/controllers/videoCtrl.js` - Revert `getVideo()` function
- `/server/controllers/blogCtrl.js` - Revert `getArticleBySlug()` function

## 💡 Future Enhancements

Consider these improvements for better admin experience:

1. **Admin Badge on Posts**: Show a visual indicator when viewing as admin
2. **Admin Audit Log**: Track when admins view private content
3. **Bulk Review Interface**: Allow admins to review multiple pending posts at once
4. **Review Comments**: Let admins leave internal notes on posts
5. **Auto-Approval Rules**: Set criteria for automatic approval (e.g., trusted users)

## ✨ Summary

**Problem:** Admins couldn't view private/paused posts for review.

**Result:** Admins can now properly review paused content while maintaining security for regular users.

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED AND READY FOR TESTING**
