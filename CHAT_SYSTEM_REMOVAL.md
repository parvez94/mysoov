## Database Impact

The following MongoDB collections are no longer used:

- `messages` - All message documents
- `conversations` - All conversation documents

**Note:** The actual database collections still exist but are no longer accessed by the application. You may want to manually drop these collections if you want to clean up the database:

```javascript
// MongoDB shell commands to drop collections (optional)
db.messages.drop();
db.conversations.drop();
```

## Socket.IO Impact

The following Socket.IO events are no longer emitted or handled:

- `newMessage` - New message notification
- `messageReceived` - Message received in conversation
- `messageDeleted` - Message deletion
- `joinConversation` - User joining conversation room
- `leaveConversation` - User leaving conversation room
- `userTyping` - User typing indicator
- `userStoppedTyping` - User stopped typing
- `markMessageRead` - Message read status update

Socket.IO is still active for other features (notifications, online status).

## Remaining Features

The following features remain intact:

- User authentication
- Video upload and management
- Comments system
- Notifications system (via Socket.IO and SSE)
- User profiles
- Follow/unfollow functionality
- Explore and Following feeds
- Settings management

## Testing Recommendations

After this removal, test the following:

1. ✅ Application loads without errors
2. ✅ Navigation works (no broken links to /messages)
3. ✅ User profiles display correctly without Message button
4. ✅ Left sidebar displays correctly without Messages menu item
5. ✅ Socket.IO still works for notifications
6. ✅ No console errors related to missing chat components

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to restore the chat system:

1. Restore files from git history before this commit
2. Re-add the routes in App.jsx and server/index.js
3. Re-add the socket event handlers in socketHandler.js
4. The database collections should still exist with data (if not dropped)
