# Notification Badge & Paused Articles - Complete Fix Summary ✅

## Overview

This document summarizes all fixes applied to resolve two separate issues:

1. **Notification badge not updating on navigation**
2. **Paused articles not visible on user profile**

---

## Issue #1: Notification Badge Not Updating on Navigation ✅

### Problem

The notification badge only updated after a full page refresh (F5), not when navigating between pages within the app. This created a poor user experience where users had to manually refresh to see updated notification counts.

### Root Cause

- The `LeftSidebar` component persists across route changes (good architecture)
- The `useNotifications` hook only fetched the unread count once on mount
- When users clicked "View" on a notification and navigated away, the badge wasn't refreshing

### Solution Implemented

We implemented a **four-pronged approach** to ensure real-time badge updates:

#### 1. Route-based Refresh (Primary Solution)

**File:** `/client/src/components/sidebars/LeftSidebar.jsx`

```javascript
import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

const location = useLocation();

useEffect(() => {
  fetchUnreadCount();
}, [location.pathname]);
```

- Watches for route changes using `useLocation().pathname`
- Triggers `fetchUnreadCount()` whenever user navigates to a new page
- Ensures badge updates immediately after viewing a notification

#### 2. Enhanced Event System

**Files:**

- `/client/src/utils/eventEmitter.js`
- `/client/src/hooks/useNotifications.js`

```javascript
// Added new event
export const NOTIFICATION_CREATED = 'NOTIFICATION_CREATED';

// Hook listens for events
useEffect(() => {
  const handleNotificationCreated = () => fetchUnreadCount();
  const handleUnreadCountUpdated = () => fetchUnreadCount();

  eventEmitter.on(NOTIFICATION_CREATED, handleNotificationCreated);
  eventEmitter.on(UNREAD_COUNT_UPDATED, handleUnreadCountUpdated);

  return () => {
    eventEmitter.off(NOTIFICATION_CREATED, handleNotificationCreated);
    eventEmitter.off(UNREAD_COUNT_UPDATED, handleUnreadCountUpdated);
  };
}, []);
```

#### 3. Periodic Polling

**File:** `/client/src/hooks/useNotifications.js`

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    fetchUnreadCount();
  }, 30000); // Poll every 30 seconds

  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

- Refreshes badge every 30 seconds
- Ensures badge stays fresh even if events are missed
- Cleaned up on component unmount

#### 4. Page Visibility API

**File:** `/client/src/hooks/useNotifications.js`

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleVisibilityChange = () => {
    if (document.visibilityState === 'visible') {
      fetchUnreadCount();
    }
  };

  document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);

  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
  };
}, []);
```

- Refreshes count when user switches back to the browser tab
- Catches updates when user returns after being away

### Files Modified (Issue #1)

1. `/client/src/utils/eventEmitter.js` - Added `NOTIFICATION_CREATED` event
2. `/client/src/hooks/useNotifications.js` - Added polling, visibility API, and event listeners
3. `/client/src/components/sidebars/LeftSidebar.jsx` - Added route-based refresh

## Issue #2: Paused Articles Not Visible on User Profile ✅

### Problem

When an admin paused an article, it disappeared from the user's profile page, even when viewing their own profile. This prevented users from:

- Seeing their paused content
- Editing paused articles to fix issues
- Understanding why their article wasn't visible

### Root Cause

The backend had correct logic to show paused articles on own profile:

```javascript
const isOwnProfile = currentUserId && String(currentUserId) === String(userId);

const query = { author: userId };
if (!isOwnProfile) {
  query.published = true;
  query.isPaused = false;
}
```

**However**, the route `/user/:userId/articles` did NOT have authentication middleware, so `req.user` was always `undefined`. This meant `isOwnProfile` was always `false`, hiding paused articles even from the owner.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Created Optional Authentication Middleware

**File:** `/server/middlewares/auth.js`

```javascript
export const optionalAuth = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.cookies.access_token;

  if (!token) {
    // No token, but that's okay - continue without setting req.user
    return next();
  }

  jwt.verify(token, process.env.SECRET_KEY, (err, user) => {
    if (!err) {
      // Token is valid, set req.user
      req.user = user;
    }
    // Continue regardless of token validity
    next();
  });
};
```

**Why Optional Authentication?**

- ✅ Allows both authenticated and unauthenticated access
- ✅ Sets `req.user` when token exists (for own profile detection)
- ✅ Continues without error when no token (for public viewing)
- ❌ Can't use `verifyToken` - it rejects requests without a token (401 error)

#### 2. Applied Middleware to Route

**File:** `/server/routes/blogRoutes.js`

```javascript
import { verifyToken, optionalAuth } from '../middlewares/auth.js';

// Before
router.get('/user/:userId/articles', getUserArticles);

// After
router.get('/user/:userId/articles', optionalAuth, getUserArticles);
```

#### 3. Added Visual Status Badges

**File:** `/client/src/components/ArticleCard.jsx`

```javascript
const isPaused = article.isPaused;
const isDraft = !article.published;

{
  isOwner && (isPaused || isDraft) && (
    <StatusBadge $isPaused={isPaused} $isDraft={isDraft}>
      {isPaused ? '⏸ Paused by Admin' : '📝 Draft'}
    </StatusBadge>
  );
}
```

**Badge Styling:**

- **Paused Articles:** Orange badge (#ff9800) with "⏸ Paused by Admin"
- **Draft Articles:** Gray badge (#9e9e9e) with "📝 Draft"
- Only visible to article owner

### Files Modified (Issue #2)

1. `/server/middlewares/auth.js` - Added `optionalAuth` middleware
2. `/server/routes/blogRoutes.js` - Applied `optionalAuth` to user articles route
3. `/client/src/components/ArticleCard.jsx` - Added status badges

## Technical Details

### Notification Badge Update Flow

```
User clicks "View" on notification
    ↓
Navigates to notification target page
    ↓
React Router updates location.pathname
    ↓
LeftSidebar's useEffect detects pathname change
    ↓
Calls fetchUnreadCount()
    ↓
Badge updates immediately
    ↓
✅ User sees updated count without manual refresh
```

### Paused Articles Authentication Flow

```
User visits profile page
    ↓
Frontend: GET /api/v1/blog/user/{userId}/articles
    ↓
Backend: optionalAuth middleware runs
    ↓
If logged in: req.user = {id, ...}
If not logged in: req.user = undefined
    ↓
getUserArticles() controller
    ↓
isOwnProfile = req.user?.id === userId
    ↓
If own profile: Return ALL articles (published, drafts, paused)
If other's profile: Return only published & non-paused articles
    ↓
Frontend: Display articles with status badges
    ↓
✅ Owner sees paused articles, others don't
```

### Why Multiple Update Mechanisms?

The notification badge uses **four different update mechanisms** for maximum reliability:

1. **Route-based (Primary):** Immediate updates on navigation
2. **Event System:** Real-time updates when notifications are created/read
3. **Polling:** Catches updates if events are missed (every 30s)
4. **Visibility API:** Updates when user returns to the tab

This redundancy ensures the badge is always accurate, even if:

- Events fail to emit
- User has multiple tabs open
- Network requests are delayed
- User switches between apps

## Security Considerations

### Notification Badge

- ✅ Only shows count to authenticated users
- ✅ Uses secure cookie-based authentication
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in badge count

### Paused Articles

- ✅ Paused articles remain hidden from public view
- ✅ Only the owner can see their paused/draft articles
- ✅ Authentication is optional, not required (public profiles work)
- ✅ Invalid tokens are ignored gracefully (no errors thrown)
- ✅ Backend enforces access control (frontend can't bypass)

---

## Status: ALL ISSUES RESOLVED ✅

### Notification Badge

- ✅ Updates immediately on navigation
- ✅ Updates every 30 seconds via polling
- ✅ Updates when switching browser tabs
- ✅ Updates via event system
- ✅ Syncs across multiple tabs

### Paused Articles

- ✅ Visible on own profile with clear badge
- ✅ Hidden from other users
- ✅ Editable by owner
- ✅ Public profiles work for logged-out users
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing code

---

## Related Patterns

### Similar to Paused Posts

- Paused posts go to "Private" tab on own profile
- Paused articles show with "Paused by Admin" badge on "Articles" tab
- Both allow editing by the owner
- Both are hidden from public view

### Similar to Notification System

- Both use event emitters for real-time updates
- Both use polling as a fallback mechanism
- Both persist across route changes
- Both handle multiple instances gracefully
