## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Problem                         | Solution                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Post becomes public immediately | Check backend code in videoCtrl.js                             |
| No notification received        | Check admin user exists, check notification creation           |
| Highlight doesn't work          | Check URL has `?highlight=<id>` parameter                      |
| No scroll to post               | Check `highlightRef` is attached, check useEffect dependencies |
| Badge doesn't show              | Check `video.pendingReview` is true                            |
