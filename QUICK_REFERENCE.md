# Quick Reference - YouTube Upload Fixes

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: YouTube Shows as "Disabled" in Admin Settings

- **Root Cause:** Route path mismatch (`/api/admin` vs `/api/v1/admin`)
- **Fix:** Added both route paths in `server/index.js`
- **Result:** Admin dashboard now correctly shows YouTube as "Enabled"

### Issue 2: 5MB Limit Applied to ALL Uploads

- **Root Cause:** Size check happened before determining storage provider
- **Fix:** Reordered logic in `server/routes/uploadRoutes.js`
- **Result:** YouTube videos bypass size limits, Cloudinary uploads respect limits

## 📊 Upload Behavior

| What You Upload | Provider Selected | Where It Goes | Size Limit      |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| **Image**       | Cloudinary        | Cloudinary    | 5MB             |
| **Image**       | YouTube           | Cloudinary    | 5MB             |
| **Video**       | Cloudinary        | Cloudinary    | Your plan limit |
| **Video**       | YouTube           | YouTube       | ✨ Unlimited    |

**Key Point:** Images ALWAYS use Cloudinary (with 5MB limit), regardless of provider setting.

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Check Admin Dashboard

```
1. Open browser → Admin Settings
2. Navigate to: Settings → Storage Settings
3. Look for YouTube status
4. Should show: "Enabled" ✅ (not "Disabled" ❌)
```

### 2. Test Large Video Upload

```
1. Select YouTube as storage provider
2. Upload a video > 5MB (e.g., 10MB video)
3. Expected: Upload succeeds ✅
4. Previous behavior: "File exceeds limit" error ❌
```

### 3. Test Image Upload with YouTube

```
1. Keep YouTube selected
2. Upload an image < 5MB
3. Expected: Uploads to Cloudinary ✅
4. Upload an image > 5MB
5. Expected: "File exceeds limit" error ✅
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Files Modified (3 files)

**1. `/server/index.js` (lines 198-199)**

```javascript
app.use('/api/v1/admin', adminRouter); // New path
app.use('/api/admin', adminRouter); // Backward compatibility
```

**2. `/server/routes/uploadRoutes.js` (lines 44-92)**

```javascript
// Determine storage provider FIRST
const willUseCloudinary =
  !isVideo || provider !== 'youtube' || !isYouTubeConfigured();

// THEN check size limits (only for Cloudinary)
if (willUseCloudinary) {
  // Size validation here
}
```

**3. `/server/controllers/adminCtrl.js` (lines 391-400)**

```javascript
res.status(200).json({
  success: true,
  storageProvider: settings.storageProvider,
  cloudinaryConfig: settings.cloudinaryConfig,
  youtubeConfig: { ...settings.youtubeConfig, isConfigured: youtubeConfigured },
  youtubeConfigured: youtubeConfigured, // Added for frontend
});
```

## 🎯 Key Logic

### Storage Provider Decision

```javascript
// For images: ALWAYS Cloudinary
if (!isVideo) {
  provider = 'cloudinary';
}

// For videos: Use setting (YouTube or Cloudinary)
if (isVideo && provider === 'youtube' && isYouTubeConfigured()) {
  provider = 'youtube'; // No size limits!
} else {
  provider = 'cloudinary'; // Apply size limits
}
```

### Size Limit Check

```javascript
// Only check size if going to Cloudinary
const willUseCloudinary =
  !isVideo || provider !== 'youtube' || !isYouTubeConfigured();

if (willUseCloudinary) {
  // Apply user's plan limit (5MB for free, more for paid)
  if (fileSize > maxSize) {
    return error; // File too large
  }
}
// If going to YouTube, skip size check entirely
```

## 🚀 Server Status

✅ Server is running with nodemon (auto-restart enabled)  
✅ All changes automatically applied  
✅ API endpoint verified: `/api/v1/admin/storage-settings` is accessible  
✅ YouTube credentials configured in `.env`

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Images Always Use Cloudinary**

   - Even when YouTube is selected as provider
   - This is intentional (YouTube is for videos only)
   - 5MB limit always applies to images

2. **YouTube Fallback**

   - If YouTube upload fails → Falls back to Cloudinary
   - Fallback WILL apply size restrictions
   - User will see appropriate error if file too large

3. **Subscription Plans**

   - Free users: 5MB limit (Cloudinary only)
   - Paid users: Higher limits based on plan
   - YouTube uploads: Unlimited (no plan restrictions)

4. **YouTube API Quota**
   - YouTube has daily API quota limits
   - Monitor usage for large-scale deployments
   - Implement quota error handling if needed

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### YouTube Still Shows as Disabled

- Check browser console for errors
- Verify frontend is calling `/api/v1/admin/storage-settings`
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Check server logs for errors

### Large Videos Still Rejected

- Verify YouTube is selected in settings
- Check `.env` has all 3 YouTube credentials
- Confirm server restarted after changes
- Check upload endpoint is using new logic

### Images Not Uploading

- Images should always work (use Cloudinary)
- Check file size is under 5MB
- Verify Cloudinary credentials in `.env`
- Check browser network tab for error details
